# Summary

Cut and Paste is a game developed in a week for the [2022 uOttawa Game Dev Club Holiday GameJam](https://itch.io/jam/uottawa-game-dev-club-holiday-jam-2022).

The objective was to create a game using [`TUI-rs`](https://docs.rs/tui/latest/tui/) and `Rust` to embody the theme cut in the style of an arcade game.
