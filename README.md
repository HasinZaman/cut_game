# Summary

Cut and Paste is a game developed in a week for the [2022 uOttawa Game Dev Club Holiday GameJam](https://itch.io/jam/uottawa-game-dev-club-holiday-jam-2022).

The objective was to create a game using [`TUI-rs`](https://docs.rs/tui/latest/tui/) and `Rust` to embody the theme cut in the style of an arcade game.

# Gameplay

The objective of the game is to maximize points before the play area is filled with elements.

Points are obtained though filling a row or column with exactly one's or zeros.

Use `wasd` or `WASD` keys to move the cursor.

Use `Q` and `E` to double the cursor size or to halve the cursor size

Use `q` and `e` to rotate the cursor

Use `X` and `V` to cut and paste values around the play area
